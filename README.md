## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log
​
## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
I learned why the console is as important as it is, console.log() is able to communicate many things to the console.​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
what didnt make sense for me was during the greeting bot for the notes switching the name of the bot was super confusing for me at first but once I figured it out it all made sense to me.​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I used AI to explain to me what the const teacherBotLocation = 'I live in ' + teacherBotLocation + "."; was doing ​and what each piece of that is. It helped me to understand in a different way away from all the coding language the reading shared that information in.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I could probably use some more practice with all of the things i've learned so far but I think working with variables is what I need the most practice with.​

### Week 1: Systems That Respond
# Learning Log
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I learned how to change my theme in VS code, HTML academy showed me the start of how we make the switcher between light mode and dark mode, I also learned how to make an image changes in a webpage.
​
​
### What Was Hard
The hardest thing for me was understanding the theme switcher on a webpage and how each of the JS lines are working together
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help me understand what each line of JS is doing in the theme switcher and how they work together, I copied and pasted the code into claude and asked for the code to be explained to me in 5th grader terms.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I need more practice with conditionals.

​
### Week 2: Remembering Choices
​
### What I Learned
A concept that clicked for me is the if statements, theyre much more logical than they were coming across in my head before.​
​
### What Was Hard
Math.floor in the conditionals confused me.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I used AI to help me understand why my image clicker was not cycling back to the beginning of the story once the story was complete, claude helped me to understand that I only had code until I reached the last image and there was nothing to cycle it back to the beginning of the images with. ​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Im unsure why some JS uses === and some only =
